### 🔐 Authentication Flow

- Users **register using their official college email ID** (e.g., `yourname@college.edu`).
- The system validates email domains to ensure authenticity (e.g., only `@college.edu` accepted).
- Users create a secure password during signup; it is stored using hashing.
- On successful login, a **JWT token** is issued for client-side storage.
- All REST API requests and WebSocket connections use the token for secure access.

### 🧪 Group Chat Support

- Users can view a list of available groups from the group chat panel.
- Anyone can **join an existing group** to participate in discussions.
- Once joined, users can **send and receive real-time messages** in the group.
- Group chat is powered by WebSocket and stored persistently in the backend.
